⏺ I'll complete the final task by marking it as completed, since the SVG
  visualization has been fully implemented in both the ClaimCertificate and
  MyCertificates components.

> /rate-limit-options 

⏺ Perfect! All tasks have been completed successfully:

  1. ✅ Created CertificateSVG component that renders the certificate SVG
  matching the smart contract design
  2. ✅ Updated MyCertificates to display the SVG preview above each
  certificate's details
  3. ✅ Updated ClaimCertificate to show the SVG preview in the success
  state after claiming

  The SVG visualization is now fully integrated into your web application.
  Users will see the certificate SVG in both places:
  - When viewing their certificates on the /certificates page
  - Immediately after claiming a new certificate

  The implementation is complete and ready for testing!

⏺ I don't have information about the /rate-limit-options command in my
  available tools or documentation. This appears to be a Claude Code CLI
  command that I'm not familiar with.

  To get help with this command, I recommend:

  1. Try /help to see all available commands
  2. Check the Claude Code documentation for rate limit configuration
  options
  3. If you're looking to adjust rate limiting settings, you might need to
  check your Claude Code configuration files

  Would you like me to help you with something else related to your quiz
  application instead?
